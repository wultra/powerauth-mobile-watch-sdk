# PowerAuth Mobile SDK for watchOS

This repository contains source codes of PowerAuth mobile SDK for watchOS, originally embedded within the main [PowerAuth mobile SDK](http://github.com/wultra/powerauth-mobile-sdk) repo. We had to split the codebase into multiple standalone git repos in the SDK version `1.7.7`. The reason why we had to do this split is explained in issue [wultra/powerauth-mobile-sdk#513](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-mobile-sdk/issues/513).

We still maintain the documentation for the library at the original location, so, if you looking for a documentation, then we recommend you to visit our [documentation portal](https://developers.wultra.com/products/mobile-security-suite/develop/powerauth-mobile-sdk/PowerAuth-SDK-for-watchOS).
